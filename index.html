    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Azamat Ibraimov</td>
      <td>It’s more convenient for plumbers to communicate with clients via messenger apps (WhatsApp/Telegram) or phone calls rather than a built-in site chat.</td>
      <td>1) How would you prefer clients to contact you — phone call, messenger, or site chat?<br>2) Would you like the site messages to be forwarded to Telegram/WhatsApp?<br>3) Do you need chat history stored on the platform?</td>
      <td>“Messenger or phone is best. I always reply faster on Telegram — a built-in chat is fine only if it forwards messages. Otherwise I might miss them.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed (partially)</td>
      <td>Add quick-contact buttons (“Write in Telegram/WhatsApp”), push or messenger notifications, and optional built-in chat linked to messengers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Baurzhan Sarsenov</td>
      <td>Partial prepayment (deposit) increases reliability and is convenient for plumbers.</td>
      <td>1) Do you usually ask for partial prepayment?<br>2) What percentage seems fair?<br>3) Are cancellations or non-payment a problem?</td>
      <td>“Yes, I take 20–30% in advance for big jobs. For small ones — full payment after. The worst is when clients cancel at the last minute. A deposit helps avoid that.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed</td>
      <td>Add an option “partial prepayment (materials/deposit)” in job requests, default 20–30%. Implement a safe refund/dispute system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Ernis Zholdoshev</td>
      <td>Plumbers are willing to pay a small platform commission if it provides stable job flow and payment guarantees.</td>
      <td>1) Would you pay a commission?<br>2) Prefer a flat fee or % of the order?<br>3) What do you expect in return?</td>
      <td>“If I get more steady orders — yes, 5–10% is OK. But a fixed 200 KGS for a small job is too high. I want guarantees of payment and help with disputes.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed (conditionally)</td>
      <td>Create a flexible model: low % for small jobs, optional premium plan with lower fee & priority. Explain fees clearly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Tursunbek Mamatov</td>
      <td>Plumbers prefer a simple cost calculator or quote template to send estimates to clients.</td>
      <td>1) Do you use cost estimate templates?<br>2) Would a built-in calculator for materials/work be useful?<br>3) Do you want to send quotes through the platform?</td>
      <td>“I calculate in my head or notebook. A calculator would help, especially for new guys. Sending a quote directly from the platform saves time.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed</td>
      <td>Add a simple estimate builder (materials, labor, transport) and “Send quote to client” button. Allow saving templates.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Saltanat Akmatova</td>
      <td>Verified profiles (ID / certificates) and ratings build client trust and benefit plumbers.</td>
      <td>1) Would you verify your ID or upload certificates?<br>2) Would a high rating help attract clients?<br>3) Are you afraid of bad reviews?</td>
      <td>“Yes, verification is good — people trust it. Ratings help too, but one bad review can ruin the profile. I’d like a way to reply or appeal.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed</td>
      <td>Add optional “Verified” badge, allow responses to reviews, add moderation/dispute system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>Kamchy Osmonov</td>
      <td>Most plumbers prefer small, quick jobs as their main income source rather than long projects.</td>
      <td>1) What gives you most of your income — small quick jobs or long projects?<br>2) How many hours per week can you spend on the platform?</td>
      <td>“Mostly quick fixes — you can do more in a day. Big projects take too long. I can work 6–8 hours daily, mostly evenings.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed</td>
      <td>Split orders into “Quick Jobs” and “Projects.” Add filters by duration/price. Allow plumbers to choose job type preference.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>Nurbek Satybaldiev</td>
      <td>Flexible scheduling (weekend/evening availability) helps plumbers get more orders.</td>
      <td>1) Would you like to set your working hours?<br>2) Would showing “available on weekends/evenings” help you get more clients?<br>3) Should the system allow time slots/booking?</td>
      <td>“Yes, schedule is important. If clients see I work evenings, they book me more often. Auto-booking is OK if it’s simple.”</td>
      <td>Confirmed</td>
      <td>Add work schedule in profile, filters for “available weekends/evenings,” optional time-slot booking system.</td>
